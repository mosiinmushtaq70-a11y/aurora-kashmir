# AuroraLens Project Journal

## Session: 2026-03-30 01:45 UTC (Production Cloud Deployment)

### Objective
Transition AuroraLens from a local development environment to a professional, 24/7 cloud architecture on Vercel and Render.

### Accomplished
- **Frontend Deployment (Vercel) [DONE ✅]**:
  - Successfully deployed the Next.js 16 app in a monorepo configuration (Root: `frontend`).
  - Resolved React 19 peer dependency conflicts with `.npmrc` (`legacy-peer-deps=true`).
  - Automated Prisma client generation using a `postinstall` script.
- **Backend Deployment (Render) [DONE ✅]**:
  - Deployed the FastAPI server with a custom `Procfile`.
  - Resolved missing dependency (`email-validator`) for Pydantic models.
  - Verified live telemetry ingestion from NOAA/NASA.
- **Cloud-to-Cloud Integration [DONE ✅]**:
  - Replaced all `localhost:8000` hardcoded fetch URLs with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` environment variable.
  - Verified that the live Vercel site is correctly pulling data from the Render backend.
- **Domain & Security [DONE ✅]**:
  - Linked custom domain and verified SSL certificate propagation.
- **Documentation**:
  - Created `DEPLOYMENT_JOURNAL.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `AURORALENS_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`.

### Verification
- [x] Vercel build passes with 100% success.
- [x] Render backend returns `{"status":"Aurora Backend is LIVE"}`.
- [x] Telemetry data (Solar Wind, Bz, Kp) is flowing correctly on the live website.
- [x] Database sync (Neon) is active.

### Paused Because
Deployment objective complete; Phase 13 signed off. Ready for long-term monitoring.

### Handoff Notes
- The site is 24/7. Future pushes to GitHub `master` will trigger automatic cloud updates.
- Environment variables are managed in the Vercel and Render dashboards.
- A future "Phase 10" optimization roadmap has been proposed in `analysis_results.md`.

## Session: 2026-03-27 17:30 UTC (Cinematic Hero & Typography Overhaul)

### Objective
Replace legacy KP indicator with a cinematic `AuroraDial` and implement a premium typography hierarchy (Manrope/Inter) for the landing page.

### Accomplished
- **AuroraDial Implementation [DONE ✅]**:
  - Built a modular, physics-driven React component using Framer Motion and SVG.
  - Implemented 60fps non-linear rotation and orbital telemetry nodes.
  - Added responsive scaling (72%) for mobile viewports.
- **Typography Overhaul [DONE ✅]**:
  - Integrated Manrope and Inter fonts via Next.js font pipeline.
  - Fixed a critical circular CSS variable reference bug that was causing silent font failure.
  - Standardized all landing page headings to `font-heading` (Manrope) and body to `font-copy` (Inter).
- **Layout Refinement**:
  - Optimized hero section vertical alignment (`pt-[76px]`) for "above the fold" search bar visibility.
  - Removed standard scrollbar tracks globally using `.hide-scrollbar` utility for a unified look.
- **Code Hygiene**:
  - Resolved `node.kp` TypeScript error by parsing values from the node state string.
  - Migrated legacy gradients to Tailwind 4.x standards.

### Verification
- [x] AuroraDial renders and rotates around true center.
- [x] Typography correctly applies Manrope/Inter after CSS variable fix.
- [x] Scrollbar rail removed from landing page.
- [x] Search bar visible on standard desktop viewport height.

### Paused Because
Session objective complete; safe handoff requested.

### Handoff Notes
- The font theme tokens are now `--font-heading` and `--font-copy` in `globals.css`.
- `AuroraDial` scaling on mobile is handled via a `transform: scale()` with negative margin compensation to maintain layout flow.
- Ensure any new components use the registered font tokens rather than arbitrary font-family strings.

## Session: 2026-03-27 15:15 IST (Dossier DOM Restructure Purge)

### Objective
Finalize the "AuroraLens Dossier Rebuild" by implementing a unified, high-fidelity 6-layer DOM hierarchy and purging all legacy location-specific views.

### Accomplished
- **Unified Dossier Architecture [DONE ✅]**:
  - Implemented `DestinationDossier.tsx` with a strict 6-layer DOM hierarchy (Level 0–5).
  - Standardized real-time telemetry, tactical intelligence, and interactive CTA layers.
  - Wired `DestinationDossier` into the global `DossierShell.tsx`.

- **Legacy View Purge [DONE ✅]**:
  - Deleted `DossierView_Kirkjufell.tsx`, `DossierView_Tromso_Polished.tsx`, and `DossierView_Fairbanks_Refined.tsx`.
  - Refactored `useAppStore.ts` to retire old view-specific routing.

### Verification
- [x] Primary dossier view renders correctly for Kirkjufell.
- [x] All 6 layers mapped correctly to the design brief.
- [x] Deleted files confirmed removed from the file system.
